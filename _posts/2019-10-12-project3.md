<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> In general, when giving credit a creditor also known as a lender provides goods and services to a debtor who can be referred to as a borrower based on the trust that the borrower will repay the lender at some point in the future in exchange for providing the goods or services to the borrower in the presence the lender receives a payment interest. The most common type of loan provided by lenders to borrowers is money, credit cards and home ownership are two very good examples of credit provided by lenders. Therefore, when a bank gives a borrower a credit card, the borrower can spend as much money as her/she wants. this money is not the borrower's moneym and he/she is required to repay the respective sum to the bank. Typically, the borrower has to repay the bank with interest and this is how the bank makes a profit. When a borrower signs a home ownership loan, a brrowers borrows money from a bank againts the borrower;s equity in a residence that the borrower wants to acquire the residence. The residence itself covers the debt in case the borrower fails to repay. The bank has the right to take ownership of the residents sell it and satisfy the remaining debt.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> The event that a borrower not being abole to repay their debt is called default, to prevents themselve from borrowers defaults, lenders must assess credit risk associated with each borrower very well. One way for lenders to diminish losses due to borrower defaults is require collaterals that would cover the outstanding debt. Another way os for the lender to increase the price of lending the funds that is the interest rate for borrowers with high credit risk. This is commonly known as risk based pricing. No matter which type of strategy the borrower would decide to pursue to diminish losses due to borrower defaults, what is most important is to be able to estimate credit risk of each borrower as precisely as possible. It is important to know that lenders inability or failure to estimate borrowers probability of default can have grave consequences for lenders and society in general. Lending to borrowers with high probability of defult is one of the main reasons for serious financial crisis such as the global financial crisis in 2008. It was the most serious financial crisis since the ties of the Great Depression in the 1930s. The main factor that led to the 2008 financial crisis was high default rates of subprime home mortgages. In the USA first low interst rates encourage financial institutions to increase mortgage. Banks were willing to finance 100 percent of more of the value of a new home. High mortgage approval rates increases the demand for homes which in turn led to increasr in housing prices because the value of homes had increased. Many homeowners borrowed money and used thier homes as a guarantee to the bank. However, a lot of them were with relatively high credit risk subprime and at some point could not continue to repay. Consequently, financial instrument based on mortgages such as mortgage backed securities lost value. Thus, big banks holding these instruments absorbed hugh losses. Therefore, that is one example why credit risk is one of the most important variables in the financial system of today </p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> The figure below shows the project workflow that I used to make the project, starting with gathering the data, cleaning, analysing the data, training and testing the model using different techniques and finally finalise the model and get the results. </p>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">About the data:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> The data was taken from Kaggle Website, the data consists of <i style="color:Maroon;">145 X 450.000</i> columns and rows after cleaning and pre-processing the data, rows and columns were cleaned, pre-processed and prepared, all features were turned into dummy variables and target was turned into dummy variable too</p>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Creating a good/bad loan class:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> the code below shows how the good and bad loan was established</p>

{% highlight js %}
# Good/ Bad Definition
loan_data['good_bad'] = np.where(loan_data['loan_status'].isin(['Charged Off', 'Default',
                                                       'Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Charged Off',
                                                       'Late (31-120 days)','Late (16-30 days)']), 0, 1)
#creating a new variable that has the value of '0' if a condition is met, and the value of '1' if it is not met.
