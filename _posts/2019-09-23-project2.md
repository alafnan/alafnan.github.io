<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Project Overview:</h1>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> If we are going to <strong>predict</strong> something important to us, we would definitely love that, right? it is get better if we know that our predictions are correct. In this blog, I am going to show you how to use linear regression analysis to make predictions for mobile phones prices and test how accurate our model is. 

We can use linear regression models (algorithems) to make predictions. Regression equations are a crucial part of the statistical output after you fit a model. The coefficients in the equation define the relationship between each independent variable (features) and the dependent variable (target) which we are going to predict. However, you can also enter values for the independent variables into the equation to predict the mean value of the dependent variable.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem; padding: 1rem;   color: #000000;   background-color: #F0EDE5; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:0.8em; text-align: left;" >

  <li>To <strong>scrape</strong> a mobile phone <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/mobile-phones-store">Website</a> using python and <strong>Beautiful soup library</strong>.</li>
    <li>To study the <strong>the nature</strong> of our collected data by using exploratory data analysis <strong>EDA</strong>.</li>
    <li>To eliminate the number of features using <strong>Feature Engineering Techniques</strong>.</li> 
  <li>To train and validate multiple <strong>models</strong> and choose the best of them.</li>
    <li>To <strong>test and validate</strong> our chosen model.</li>
    <li>To provide some <strong>bussiness solutions</strong> and <strong>prediction</strong> for mobile phone companies.</li> </ul></div>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Project Workflow:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> The figure below shows the project workflow that I used to make the project, starting with scraping the data, cleaning, analysing the data, training and testing the model using different techniques and finally finalise the model and get the results. </p>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Visualising the data:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> The data was visualised using <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong> via Python3 syntax as shown in the figure below. The figure shows the first and the last couple of rows out of a total of <i style="color:Maroon;">1106 X 7</i> after cleaning the data, rows and columns were cleaned using the follwoing comman line {% highlight js %}df.head()      // to read my DataFrame df{% endhighlight %} Notice that the data was read from an <strong>csv</strong> file where i saved the data in after i scraped the website. </p>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Web Scraping and Gathered Data:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> The image below shows clearly the steps followed to gathered the data and notice that the data gathered before <strong>cleaning</strong> where <strong>1500</strong> and after cleaning they became <strong>1106</strong>.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Features Selection and their nature:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The image below show different distributions for the data I gathered, and we can clearly see that the data for <strong>price</strong> is not normal and the reason being is that most of the data gathered where for phones which are relatively cheap and a few phones such as <strong>iphones</strong> and <strong>Samsung</strong> are relatively expensive but few. the same thing is applied to <strong>ROM Storgae</strong> of the phones which are offered by the website. we can see that for expensive phones such as <strong>iphones</strong> and <strong>Samsung</strong> they tend to have a very high storage normally between <strong>64 GB</strong> and <strong>512 GB</strong> and for cheaper phones the number is relatively less than that. We can also notice that <strong>Screen size</strong> and other features they are normally distributed as they are standarised for almost all phone in the list apart from a few phones</p>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Heat Map:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">For the reason explained in the previous partm the heat map shows a very high correlation between Storage and price and that was expected to see, this is can make a model which will not be so robut for cheap phone, so what about if we discarded ROM and normalise the price. this will lead to decreasing the prices of our dataframe and hence take into considerations cheap phones as well</p>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Normalising our prices:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">It is quite simple to normalise our target so we can predict how less wanted phones can be improved to get more attentions and hence sell the products effectively, the figure below shows how to normalise the price data using <strong>LOG</strong> in numpy</p>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Before and after using LOG:</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The figure below shows the difference before and after using log. we can clearly seen that the performace of <strong>R-squared</strong> has increased due to adding more normal feature to our <strong>OLS</strong> model</p>

![Project Approach Image]({{ site.url }}/images/6.png)


{% highlight js %}
//Create your model
x = sm.add_constant(x)
model = sm.OLS(y, x)
fit = model.fit()
fit.summary()
{% endhighlight %}

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Final Results and Observations</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Multiple models were trained using cross-validation method. ridge regression, linear regression and second order polynomial were trained. the highest R-squared were obtained by the polynomial model. However, the problem with this model is that it adds multiple interactions terms and multiple feature, so linear regression which was the second highest model was chosen. The figure below shows the residuals and Q-Q polts.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em; color:#000000; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Actual and predicted values</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The figure below show the tested values the actual outputs gathered from the website and the predicted values by the model. Notice that the model is acting lineary when the prices are low and as increase the prediction decreases and that is because of the decision made at the beginning of this project we we normalised the prices so we focused on low price phones</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Linear regression model was used.</li>
    <li>Better predictions for low prices phones due to the use of log.</li>
    <li>Coefficients show that RAM, screen size and rate of the phone increases are important when it comes to people preferences.</li> 
  <li>Small companies should focus of promotions more.</li>
    <li>ROM, screen size, RAM and the rate of the website is quite important for small companies to increase their sales</li></ul></div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 1.2rem; padding: 1rem;   color: #000000;   background-color: #F0EDE5; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:0.8em; text-align: left;" >
  <ul>
  <li>Use a different one or multiple websites to gather the data for modern mobiles only.</li></ul></div>
